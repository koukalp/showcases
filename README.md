This repository allows to view code samples of my work. It is not intended to work when downloaded. It only reveals the code structure I write. 

## Meaning of the code
The code demonstrates a single Ember "POD" Component. "POD" only refers to the fact, that in the file directory the .js, .less and .hbs file are located in the same folder. 

The component itself is very simple - it allows the user to switch from one hotel star category to another. However since the server doesn't send the client such a simple structure, the client needs to apply data transformations and figure out the data that need to be passed in to the API in order to switch hotel category

Please see the code and comments in the .js file to get more insights.
